## Resume
This paper focuses on XSS and SQL injection detections. It analyzes the user requests and using regular expression to mapping
current request with generated requests.

Firstly we compare web request for SQLi and XSS, if it is invalid, it may be a potential attack. 

Otherwise, we further compare SQL request with mapping patterns.

After two mapping above, we can verify if this request is a potential attack.
