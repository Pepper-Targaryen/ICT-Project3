​    Web application attacks are an increasingly important area in information security and digital forensics. This paper aimed to investigate the techniques used in the detection and forensics of web application attacks, which will be used in upcoming studies.

​    The paper pointed out that current methods of security have proven to be unreliable, and an accessible web application in front end could be exploited by various types of attacks. There are two basic detection methods currently being adopted in research: Anomaly-based and Signature-based. The paper discussed the detection techniques such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, honeypots and forensic techniques.

​    Available detection techniques, such as web application firewalls and application intrusion detection systems have a high accuracy and performance rate for known attacks. In this survey, they highlighted the web application forensic and web application honeypots as a post-detection technique. Those technologies have relatively limited real-time detection, but they offer valuable insights into attack detection through the analysis of successful attacks and the discovery of the unknown ones. Web application forensics and honeypots collect a massive amount of data. Data-mining can be applied to this data with a number of criteria, such as the preservation of digital evidence and data analysis, accuracy, and reliability.
